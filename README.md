## Vision

Imagine that you are moving to a new country, and this country is completely foreign to you. You don't know how you will orientate there, how you will get information about all the important places and the interesting activities and attractions.<br/>
**Worrying, isn't it?**

Now, imagine that despite all your concerns, you have moved to the new country. Fortunately, you meet a new charming friend who lives there.
You tell her about your worries, and she promises you that she will guide you with all the information you need and will accompany you to any place you want to go.
Over the time, you become best friends.<br/>
**Relaxing, isn't it?** 

Finally, imagine:<br/>
The "coutry" is Bar Ilan University.<br/>
